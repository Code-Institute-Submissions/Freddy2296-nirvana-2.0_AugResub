        <h2>One of the Biggest bands of the 90s</h2>
        <h5>Taking over the world </h5>
       <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hTWKbfoikeg?autoplay=1&mute=1>" width="300" height="200">
        <p>The band took of big in 1991 when they were looking to sign for a major label company because no indie label could
            buy them out of there contract. They signed with DGC records in 1990 thanks Susan Sliver they were able to find this 
            record company.They met Silver in Los Angeles and she introduced them to agent Don Muller and music business attorney Alan Mintz,
             who was specialized in finding deals for new bands. Mintz started sending out Nirvana's demo tape to major labels looking for deals.
             When Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, Novoselic thanked Silver during his speech for 
             "introducing them to the music industry properly"
        </p>
        <p>After signing, the band began recording its first major label album, Nevermind.
              DGC Records was hoping to sell 250,000 copies of Nevermind, the same they had achieved with Sonic Youth's Goo.
               However, the first single "Smells Like Teen Spirit" quickly gained momentum, boosted by major airplay of the music video on MTV. 
               As it toured Europe during late 1991, the band found that its shows were dangerously oversold,
                that television crews were becoming a constant presence onstage,
                 and that "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was almost omnipresent on radio and music television.
                  By Christmas 1991, Nevermind was selling 400,000 copies a week in the US. </p>

        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6P0SitRwy8?autoplay=1&mute=1>" width="300" height="200">
        <p>The death of lead singer Kurt Cobain took a big hit to all fans and was devasting for such rock roll icon.
            Cobain suffered for drug substance abuse and enrolled in rehab for a herion addiction but after being released
            he return to settle. One week later, on April 8, 1994, 
            Cobain was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound at his home in the Denny-Blaine neighborhood of the city.
        </p>
        <p>Truley one of the biggest icon's of the 90 Kurt Cobain death took a big toll on fan's and remaining band memebers.
            Nirvana was no more after Cobain death,Plans for a live album, Verse Chorus Verse, were canceled as Novoselic and Grohl
             found assembling the material so soon after Cobain's death emotionally overwhelming.
             Instead, in November 1994, DGC released the MTV Unplugged performance as MTV Unplugged in New York;
              it debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, and earned Nirvana a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.
